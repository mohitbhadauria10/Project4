```{r, include=FALSE}
mypackages = c("recommenderlab", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "reshape2")   # required packages
tmp = setdiff(mypackages, rownames(installed.packages()))  # packages need to be installed
if (length(tmp) > 0) install.packages(tmp)
lapply(mypackages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Step 1: Set the seed to be the last 4-dig of University ID.

```{r}
set.seed(6682)
```

## Step 2: Create 

- **train data** that contains about 60% rows of the ratings.dat from the MovieLens 1M dataset (of the same format);
- **test data** that contains about 20% of the user-movie pairs from the ratings.dat from the MovieLens 1M dataset.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ratings = read.csv('ratings.dat', sep = ':', 
    colClasses = c('integer', 'NULL'), header = FALSE)
colnames(ratings) = c('UserID', 'MovieID', 'Rating', 'Timestamp')
ratings$Timestamp = NULL;
train.id = sample(nrow(ratings), floor(nrow(ratings)) * 0.6)
train = ratings[train.id, ]
test = ratings[-train.id, ]
test.id = sample(nrow(test), floor(nrow(test)) * 0.5)
test = test[test.id, ]
label = test[c('UserID', 'Rating')]
test$Rating = NA
```

## Step 3: Build two models to predict the movie rating for each user-movie pair in the test data. 

Using `evaluate`, I run through cross-validation test among all available models and found `UBCF`, `POPULAR` and `SVDF` perform better (measured by RMSE) than other models. Thus, for this assignment, I will use two models as,

- UBCF: User-based collaborative filtering. 
  - parameter: normalize = 'Z-score', method = 'cosine', nn = 5
- SVDF: Funk SVD with gradient descend. Funk SVD decomposes a matrix (with missing values) into two components U and V. The singular values are folded into these matrices. The approximation for the original matrix can be obtained by R = UV'. This model predicts new data rows by estimating the u vectors using gradient descend and then calculating the reconstructed complete matrix r for these users via r = uV'.
  - parameter: normalize = 'Z-score'

```{r}
models = list(
  UBCF = list(normalize = 'Z-score', method = 'cosine', nn = 5),
  SVDF = list(normalize = 'Z-score')
)
start.time = Sys.time()
R = acast(train, UserID ~ MovieID, value.var = 'Rating')
R = as(R, 'realRatingMatrix')
rmses = rep(0, length(models))
names(rmses) = names(models)
for (m in 1:length(models)) {
  rec = Recommender(R, method = names(models)[m],
      parameter = models[[m]])
  
  recom = predict(rec, R, type = 'ratings')
  rec_list = as(recom, 'list')
  
  # For all lines in test file, one by one
  for (u in 1:nrow(test)){
      userid = as.character(test$UserID[u])
      movieid = as.character(test$MovieID[u])
      
      rating = rec_list[[userid]][movieid]
      test$Rating[u] = ifelse(is.na(rating), 2.5, rating)
  }
  
  rmses[m] = RMSE(test$Rating, label$Rating)
}
end.time = Sys.time()
run.time = as.numeric(difftime(end.time, start.time, units = 'secs'))
```

Computation time: `r ceiling(run.time)` seconds

## Step 4: Report the RMSE (Root-mean-square error) of these two models on the test data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(rmses)
```
